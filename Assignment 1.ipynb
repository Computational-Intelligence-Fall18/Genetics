    "# Genetics\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement main parts of genetic algorithms. <br>\n",
    "There is a lot of algorithms researchers use in each part and your are going to implement the famous ones. And of course there are some new ideas to implement here(the harder you work the better grade you get)!\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementations\n",
    "1. First of all, you should implement everything **only using numpy or built-in libraries**.\n",
    "2. You should only implement **functions** to do the task for each module. This means, you have to assume some predefined code and you implementd your code,using that.\n",
    "3. You can define sub functions for simplifying your task.\n",
    "3. we've provided a **sample class of chromosome** with some attributes. You can assume that this class will be parsed as the chromosome in your functions. \n",
    "4. In some of modules, **you need to change the class** to add some new attribute. To do so, you should **extend class and add new attributes** to your new implemented class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "1. **Modules have weighted grades** so the more work you put in the more points you get.\n",
    "2. **Some modules are optional for some groups**, implementing them will have bonus points with respect to the it's weight.\n",
    "3. **Groups are categorized based on theirs skills**. So the more skilled you are the  more tasks and different points for each task you get..\n",
    "4. (optional) **Unit testing** has bonus points. If you use online CI tools like Travis CI or Azure DevOps for testing, you'll get more bonus points!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you want to use unit testing in your codes, please provide high quality tests. writing low quality test is just a waste time (Go play GTA instead!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "1. For god's sake write something! maybe someday you have to use your own project(hopefully).\n",
    "2. You have to provide documentation for all of the function **arguments** and **return value** and of course a **simple explanation about your function** and a **numerical example** of how would your function work.\n",
    "3.Don't know how to write docs in python? OK,google it!\n",
    "\n",
    "This <a href='https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/'>tutorial</a> may help you to write better docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "1. We've provided some modules for each section.\n",
    "2. Each **module will be a function** as described in **<a href='#Implementaitons'>implementation**</a> section.\n",
    "3. There is a **little description** on what each module is and some **links as reference**. You must read those links and implement modules based on algorithms provided in the references. In some modules, we've provided **a paper,related to the module**. It is your task to **study the papers and find out how to implement the modules**.\n",
    "4. Your functions should work for all type of chromosome class(flattened or not). So you have to pass a mendatory argument to determine **what type of choromosome you have**."

    "**Note: Because github is not private, you should not push your codes before deadline, but if you like to using Git Version Control system, use <a href='https://bitbucket.org/'>Bitbucket</a> or <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/'>Microsoft Azure Devops</a>. <br>\n",
